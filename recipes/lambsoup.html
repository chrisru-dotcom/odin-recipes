    <h3><em> Odin's fav soup</em> </h3>
<p> Kjötsúpa is a simple Icelandic lamb soup made from braising cuts of lamb or mutton and stored root vegetables.  
    The meat is braised bone-in and creates its own stock while the coarse root vegetables give the soup a hearty texture and a subtle sweetness. </p>
